# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 1

### Creation of a model
I have created a model that can recognise when someone has shown rock, paper or scissors.

## Milestone 2

### Creation of the virtual environment

I created a conda environment and download all the libraries required to run the model. I also tested the model with sample code to ensure it worked correctly.

## Milestone 3

### Creation of the game using code

Firstly, I created get_computer_choice that makes the computer randomly select Rock, Paper or Scissors. Then, I created get_user_choice that asks the user to choice either Rock, Paper or Scissors. Next, I created get_winner that determined who wins based on the computer's and the user's choice. 

Finally, I brought all the functions together with a function called play().

## Milestone 4

### Using the model in the game

Firstly, I created a function called get_prediction that returns the output of the model you used earlier. I, then, added a coutdown from 3. Afterwards, I added code so that the game will run until someone wins three times.

The game wasn't accurate enough so I added more pictures to the model. It still wasn't accurate enough so I improved the model again.

Finally, I turned all the functions into one class.
